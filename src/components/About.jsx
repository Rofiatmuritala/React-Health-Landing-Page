        <p>
          Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality identified in
          infants and children. Approximately a quarter of the world's
          population suffers from anemia, almost 2 billion people, with almost
          half of children &#60; 5 years of age affected in 2016. Anemia is
          associated with increased morbidity and mortality in children,
          particularly children of preschool age. There are many causes of
          anemia, both inherited and acquired, and these causes vary widely in
          populations across the world. Anemia is not a specific disease entity
          per se but represents a heterogeneous group of pathologic conditions.
